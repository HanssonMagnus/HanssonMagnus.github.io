title: [Book Review] Fooled by Randomness
---

## Introduction
Fooled by Randomness is clearly famous with over 36k ratings on goodreads, with an average rating of 4.03. This rating is imo way too high. My general impression of Taleb when reading this book is that he is too arrogant compared to his skill level. Sometimes this is amusing to read, Taleb bashing everyone, but most of the time it is just silly. The core concepts of the book are taught in statistics 1 and the other concepts in statistics 2.  Although, the concepts discussed are important and they are concepts that the human brain sometimes is having a hard time to consult during everyday decision making. This is why it is good, from time to time, remind the brain to think logically.

In this review I will basically extract those part of Taleb’s book worth reading so you don’t have to read the whole thing.
