<h2>Building the Corne</h2>
<p>
There are several guides on how to build the keyboard. However, there are some things to keep in
mind, e.g., some of the Corne PCBs use SMD components that you need to be a bit more careful with,
some recommend to solder at
around 270 degrees Celsius, whereas with through hole components at 350. I accidentally destroyed a
pad and had to fix a bodge wire to get the failed switch to work.
</p>

<h2>Flashing the microcontrollers</h2>
<p>
The flashing process: cd to the qmk directory and create a new keymap for your user for the Corne
keyboard; cd to where you have your json keymap file, created with
<a href="https://config.qmk.fm/#/dekunukem/duckypad/LAYOUT"> QMK configurator </a>
; create the keymap.c and copy it
to the keymap directory; stop the modem manager; flash the elite-c and then the pro micro.
</p>

<pre>
<code>cd ~/qmk_firmware
qmk new-keymap -kb crkbd
cd ~/Keyboard/corne/keymap
qmk json2c crkbd_rev1_legacy_dhm.json > keymap.c
cp keymap.c ~/qmk_firmware/keyboards/crkbd/keymaps/HanssonMagnus/
cd ~/qmk_firmware
systemctl stop ModemManager.service
sudo make crkbd/rev1:HanssonMagnus
sudo make crkbd/rev1:HanssonMagnus:dfu
sudo make crkbd/rev1:HanssonMagnus:avrdude
</code>
</pre>

<p>
Some changes you might want to do before you flash are: comment out the tapping parameter in
the config.h, it is set to 100 and default is 200; change "no" to "yes" for "EXTRAKEY_ENABLE" in
rules.mk if you want to use media keys.
</p>

<h2>Overall impression</h2>
<p>
The layout of the Corne keyboard is nice. Even though I use the same keymap on other
keyboards, the slight column stagger and the thumb keys make it pleasant. The fact that the
microcontrollers are mounted on the top side of the PCB enables shorter stand-offs for the sandwich
case and thus it becomes a bit slimmer.
