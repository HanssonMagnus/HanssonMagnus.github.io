Hi there!

I'm Magnus, a PhD student in financial economics with focus on quantitative finance at University of Gothenburg. This is my personal page where I upload posts to share with friends in order to initiate discussions.

Much of my time is spent with finance/economics, mathematics, coding, machine learning and other interesting subjects. I like to analyze data and apply algorithms to solve problems.
