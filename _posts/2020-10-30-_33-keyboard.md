## _33 keyboard
The [\_33 keyboard](https://github.com/tominabox1/_33-Keyboard) by tominabox1 is a 3D printed case
with top mount and a PCB designed for the case. It is a fun board to challenge your layer
optimization.

## Is it useable?
The short answer is yes. It is all a matter of using layers in an efficient way. Is it better than
a 40%? I think it is a matter of preferences. Although, sub 40 keyboards, in my opinion, doesn't add
to ergonomics or functionality, they are definitely usable. The question is; if you are minimizing
both the number of key presses as well as the finger traveling distance, what should you choose?
