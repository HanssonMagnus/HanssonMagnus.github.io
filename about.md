Hi there!

I'm Magnus, a PhD student in quantitative finance at University of Gothenburg.

Much of my time is spent with finance, mathematics, coding, machine learning and other interesting stuff. In the past I've worked as a data science engineer. I like to analyze data and apply machine learning algorithms in order to solve problems.
