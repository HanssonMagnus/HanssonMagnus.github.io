title: How to get a job 101
---

## Introduction
Lately I have had a couple of friends asking me about job applications, summer jobs, internships, graduate programs and so forth within mathematics, data science, etcetera. This is the reason for this post.

My first advice is to make job applications one of your new hobbies. Spend time on Google, Reddit, blogs and read much about it. Of course it helps to read one blog post or ask one friend, but you need to build yourself a coprehensive understanding of the matter.

Start with the attitude that you can and will get a cool job that will be inspiring and interesting!

## First
I believe that in order to efficiently apply for jobs and make the process smooth the first thing one needs to do is to define some goals. Where do you want to work, i.e. what cities would you like to live in? What industry do you want to work in? Do you want to work at a small new firm, an large old firm, and so on? When you have defined your goals, time plan etc you're ready to start preparing.

## Where to find a job?
In order to apply to potentially great jobs one needs to find them. Here are some ways:

#### LinkedIn
I've found LinkedIn extremely helpful. LinkedIn has a job page where you can type in keywords together with location in order to find
matching positions. One of the strengths with this seach engine is the generality in the keywords. If one is typing data science as a
keyword the engine will return positions that are directly linked to data science but the engine will also return positions that are
indirectly linked to the keyword. The search engine is probably using some ML algorithm in order to return satisfactory results.

There is also a LinkedIn job mobile app which makes it easy to check for positions every day. Furthermore, one can subscribe to job
categories, keywords and so on. Sometimes jobs posted on LinkedIn have an easy apply function, in which one can apply directly with
one's LinkedIn profile. This allows for a fast and parallel application process. In fact, with this functionality one could write a script automatically applying to jobs ;)

Quite frankly I definitely had most success using LinkedIn and after a while I didn't use any other job engines.

#### AngleList
I got recommended to try out [AngleList](https://angel.co/) by a friend last year when I was applying for jobs. I never had the
opportunity to try it out, but the site hosts a lot of jobs within data science.

#### Kaggle
[Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/) is a website for data analysis and data science. Kaggle can be seen as a data science community. Datasets
are hosted and data competitions are launched. This is a good way to get hands on experience analyzing data and also meet companies that
are interested in data science. Jobs are also posted here.

## What is a good CV?
There are of course a lot of different opinions when it comes to constructing a resume. In my opinion a CV should be fun, look a bit
innovative and give the reader a competent impression. How this is done varies from industry to industry. During some of my years at uni
I worked in finance during the summers. The banking culture is much more serious when it comes to resumes and personal letters, than e.g.
tech companies. This means that you need to adjust your resume a bit to the readers.

#### CV template?
If you are applying for jobs at companies where they have seen a lot of innovative resumes etc, I would not use any pre built tool in 
order to render the CV. I would build it completely from scratch with inspiration from other nice looking CV's. This can be done in e.g. LaTeX or Powerpoint. The reason for this is
simply that it doesn't look as nice if you are using the same resume template as everyone else.

When I applied for jobs I mostly applied to smaller firms in Scandinavia, hence I could get away with a newer CV template. I found
[Novo Resume](https://novoresume.com/) by accident and registered a free account with my student email. In my opinion these CV's are
very attractive and have an easy to read structure. One negative thing that I noticed was that the way to customize was quite limited.
Again, I would not use this template if applying to e.g. Google.

#### Different CV's?
The simple answer is yes. When I applied for jobs I first made two different types of CV's, because I applied to jobs within two
different industries: tech and finance. Depending on which industry you apply to you want to emphasize different skills etc. When I had
these two base resumes it was easy to make small adjustments before applying to each individual ad.

#### What to include?
This is of course also personal preference. At the time I wrote my resume I had a fairly updated LinkedIn profile so I used that one to build my CV. I focused a lot on skills and what I had done, rather than blindly listing the standard things like education, previous jobs etc. What makes you unique?

#### Good comment/quote from reddit user [womp_womprat](https://www.reddit.com/user/womp_womprat):
I’d say there are 2 thoughts to consider when tailoring a resume:

* Industry = different industries might leverage different types of models more than others, so if you can call out past experience in the preferred model types, the better. For example, finance might lean more towards time series models, if it’s a retail-type position then maybe experience in recommendation systems is more relevant to place prominently in a CV, and so on. You’d have to research a little in advance to know which models are most relevant to the industry at hand, though.

* Role = also tailor based on your read of the job description. If it is/sounds like a more analyst-type role (if vague, usually can tell from more buzzwords like “talk to stakeholders”, “support product decisions” etc or any mention of technologies like Tableau), then you can focus more on communications experience and/or data viz, or similar. If it’s a tech-heavy role (e.g. all of the cutting edge tech words du jour, references to engineering, etc), then as much software engineering and machine learning past experience you can call out, the better.

Final note is only to tailor to what you can legitimately claim. For the end goal of getting a job, it’s much better to be truthful and send a generic resume than it is to lie and say you have Experience X when you really don’t. For example, emphasizing time series when you have no background in it might get you past the resume pile...but if a later interview asks you something like “What’s an ARIMA model?” and you have no clue, it’ll be an instant reject.

Source: have interviewed self-proclaimed “advanced in statistics” candidates who would then mess up the most basic of basics in standard linear regression, which pretty much ended things then and there.

## How to write a great personal letter?
When writing a personal letter I would say that you should answer a couple of questions. Below are some of the ones that I'm thining of right now, but there are probably more, the safest thing is to google further.

- How can you help them / why should they hire you?
- How they will help you / how they will help you develop.
- What makes you excited (in a work situation)?
- Any direct questions they want to know from the ad.

Speak truth and do it with confidence.

## GitHub portfolio?
If you are applying to jobs where you are supposed to code I would definitely include my GitHub profile in the resume. If you do not
have any repos it is time to create them. I regret that I didn't use GitHub more frequently during uni, that would have saved some work.
Also some of the projects I did back then will I never repeat.

## They ask for a lot of advanced skills!
A lot of job ads within data science, ML etc are asking for a lot of advnaced qualifications. You will of course feel that if you have a totally different background than they ask for, it might not be worth the time to apply. But if you have one or a couple of the skills they are asking for, then you might very well get the job! Sometimes a company doesn't even know what they want or need. If you look past what they are writing in the qualifications and try to understand the problems they try to solve, then you can write a much better letter.

Also, don't be afraid of admitting that you do not have all the skills that they are looking for, but state clearly that you would be more than happy to learn. I wrote in a lot of my letters that if they wanted me to learn some skill before I start that would be no problem.

## Overall attitude and tips when applying for jobs

- When going on an interview you are equally much interviewing them. You don't want to work wherever!
- Go all in every time! If you get a job that you don't want in the end you don't have to take it.
- Start applying early, this process takes time and your applications will improve over time. Looking at my first CV when I started applying for graduate positions compared to my CV when I had applied for a couple of months, you see a dramatic difference.

- But again! The most important things are: Do your own research and take in as many different sources of information as possible!
