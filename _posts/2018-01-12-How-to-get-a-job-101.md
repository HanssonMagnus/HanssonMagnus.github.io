title: How to get a job 101
---

## Introduction
Lately I have had a couple of friends asking me about job applications, summer jobs, internships, graduate programs and so forth within
mathematics, data science, etcetera. This is the reason for this post.

My first advice is to make job applications one of your new hobbies. Spend time on Google, Reddit, Blogs and read much about it. Of course it helps to read one blog post or ask one friend, but you need to build yourself a coprehensive understanding of the matter.

Start with the attitude that you can and will get a cool job that will be inspiring and interesting.

## Where to find a job?
In order to apply to cool jobs one needs to find them. Here are some ways:

### LinkedIn
I've found LinkedIn extremely helpful. LinkedIn has a job page where you can type in keywords together with location in order to find
matching positions. One of the strengths with this seach engine is the generality in the keywords. If one is typing data science as a
keyword the engine will return positions that are directly linked to data science but the engine will also return positions that are
indirectly linked to the keyword. The search engine is probably using some ML algorithm in order to return satisfactory results.

The is also a LinkedIn job mobile app which makes it easy to check for positions every day. Furthermore, one can subscribe to job
categories, keywords and so on. Sometimes jobs posted on LinkedIn have an easy apply function, in where one can apply directly with
one's LinkedIn profile. This allows for a fast and parallel application process. In fact, with this functionality one could write a script
automatically applying to jobs.

Quite frankly I definitely had most success using LinkedIn and after a while I didn't use any other job engines.

### AngleList
I got recommended by a friend to try out [AngleList](https://angel.co/) by a friend last year when I was applying for jobs. I never had the
opportunity to try it out, but the site hosts a lot of jobs within data science.

### Kaggle
[Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/) is a website for data analysis and data science. Kaggle can be seen as a data science community. Datasets
are hosted and data competitions are launched. This is a good way to get hands on experience analyzing data and also meet companies that
are interested in data science.

## What is a good CV?
There are of course a lot of different opinions when it comes to constructing a resume. In my opinion a CV should be fun, look a bit
innovative and give the reader a competent impression. How this is done varies from industry to industry. During some of my years at uni
I worked in finance during the summers. The banking culture is much more serious when it comes to resumes and personal letters, than e.g.
tech companies.

#### CV template?
If you are applying for jobs at companies where they have seen a lot of innovative resumes etc, I would not use any pre built tool in 
order to render the CV. I would build it completely from scratch with inspiration from other nice looking CV's. The reason for this is
simply that it doesn't look as nice if you are using the same resume template as everyone else.

When I applied for jobs I mostly applied to smaller firms in Scandinavia, hence I could get away with a newer CV template. I found
[Novo Resume](https://novoresume.com/) by accident and registered a free account with my student email. In my opinion these CV's are
very attractive and have an easy to read structure. One negative thing that I noticed was that the way to customize was quite limited.
Again, I would not use this template if applying to e.g. Google.

#### Different CV's?
The simple answer is yes. When I applied for jobs I first made two different types of CV's, because I applied to jobs within two
different industries: tech and finance. Depending on which industry you apply to you want to emphasize different skills etc. When I had
these two base resumes it was easy to make small adjustments before applying to each individual application.

## How to write a great personal letter?
When writing a personal letter I would say that you should answer a couple of questions:

- How can you help them / why should they hire you?
- How they will help you / how they will help you develop.
- What makes you excited (in a work situation)?
- Any direct questions they want to know from the ad.

Speak truth and do it with confidence.

## GitHub portfolio?
If you are applying to jobs where you are supposed to code I would definitely include my GitHub profile in the resume. If you do not
have any repos it is time to create them. I regret that I didn't use GitHub more frequently during uni, that would have saved some work.
Also some of the projects I did back then will never be repeated.

## They ask for a lot of advanced skills!
A lot of job ads within data science, ML etc are asking for a lot of advnaced qualifications. You will of course feel that if you have a totally different background than they ask for, it might not be worth the time to apply. But if you have one or a couple of the skills they are asking for, then you might very well get the job! Sometimes a company doesn't even know what they want or need. If you look past what they are writing in the qualifications and try to understand the problems they try to solve, then you can write a much better letter.

Also, don't be afraid of admitting that you do not have all the skills that they are looking for, but state clearly that you would be more than happy to learn. I wrote in a lot of my letters that if they wanted me to learn some skill before I start that would be no problem.

## Overall attitude and tips when applying for jobs

- When going on an interview you are equally much interviewing them. You don't want to work wherever!
- Go all in every time! If you get a job that you don't want in the end you don't have to take it.
- Start applying early, this process takes time and your applications will improve over time.
