title: Fooled by Randomness

## Introduction
Fooled by Randomness is clearly famous, with over 36k ratings on Goodreads (with an average of 4.03 out of 5). It's not the best book I've read, but it's amusing. This post consists of quotes from the book so I don't have to re-read it, and you can get a feel for the book.

The best description of my lifelong business in the market is “skewed bets”, that is, I try to benefit from rare events, events that do not tend to repeat themselves frequently, but, accordingly present a large payoff when they occur. I try to make money infrequently, as infrequently as possible, simply because I believe that rare events are not fairly valued, and that the rarer the event, the more undervalued it will be in price. In addition to my own empiricism,  think that the counter-intuitive aspect of the trade (and the fact that our emotional wiring does not accommodate it) gives me some form of advantage.

The statement “The market never goes down 20% in a given three-month period” can be tested but is completely meaningless if verified. I can quantitatively reject the proposition by finding counterexamples, but it is not possible for me to accept it simply because, in the past, the market never went down 20% in any three-month period (you cannot easily make the logical leap from “has never gone down” to “never goes down”). Samples can be greatly insufficient; markets may change; we may not know much about the market from historical information.

You can more safely use the data to reject than to confirm hypothesis. Why? Consider the following statements: “No swan is black, because I look at four thousand swans and found none” and “Not all swans are white”.

Niederhoffer’s publicized hiccup came from his selling naked options based on his testing and assuming that what he saw in the past was an exact generalization about what could happen in the future. He relied on the statement “The market has never done this before”, so he sold puts that made a small income if the statement was true and lost hugely in the event of it turning out to be wrong. When he blew up, close to a couple of decades of performance were overshadowed by a single event that only lasted a few minutes.

I also learned to stay away from people of a competitive nature, as they have a tendency to commoditize and reduce the world to categories, like how many papers they publish in a given year, or how they rank in the league tables.

I am an exceedingly naive falsificationist. Why? Because I can survive being one. My extreme and obsessive Popperism is caried out as follows. I speculate in all of my activities on theories that represent some vision of the world, but with the following stipulation: No rare event should harm me. In fact, I would like all conceivable rare events to help me. My idea of science diverges with that of the people around me walking around calling themselves scientists. Science is mere speculation, mere formulation of conjecture.

As an option trader, I have noticed that people tend to undervalue options as they are usually unable to correctly mentally evaluate instruments that deliver an uncertain payoff, even when they are fully conscious of the mathematics. Even regulators reinforce such ignorance by explaining to people that options are a “decaying” or “wasting” asset. Options that are out of the money are deemed to “decay”, by losing their premium between two dates.

…

They confuse the expected value and the most likely scenario (here the expected value is 1 and the most likely scenario is for the option to be worth 0). They mentally overweight the state that is the most likely, namely, that the market does not move at all. The option is simply the weighted average of the possible states the asset can take.
There is another type of satisfaction provided by the option seller. Is is the steady return and the steady feeling of reward, what psychologists call “flow”. It is very pleasant to go to work in the morning with the expectation of being up some small money. Is requires some strength of character to accept the expectation of bleeding a little, loosing pennies on a steady basis even if the strategy is bound to be profitable over longer periods.

…

I divide the community of option traders into two categories: “premium sellers” and “premium buyers”. Premium sellers (also called option sellers) sells options, and generally make steady money. Premium buyers do the reverse. Option sellers, is is said, eat like chickens and go to the bathroom like elephants. Alas, most option traders I encountered in my career are “premium sellers”, when they blow up it is generally other people’s money.

…

As previously discussed, our actions, are not quite guided by the parts of our brain that dictate rationality. We think with our emotions and there is no way around it. For the same reason, people who are otherwise rational engage in smoking or in fights that get them no immediate benefits; likewise people sell options even when they know that it is not a good thing to do. But things can get worse. There is a category of people, generally finance academics, who, instead of fitting their actions to their brains, fit their brains to their actions. These people go back and unwittingly cheat with the statistics to justify their actions. In my business, they fool themselves with statistical arguments to justify their option selling.

My lesson from Soros is to start every meeting at my boutique by convincing everyone that we are a bunch of idiots who know nothing and are mistake-prone, but happen to be endowed with the rare privilege of knowing it. The scientist’s behavior while facing the refutation of his ideas has been studied in depth as part of the so-called attribute bias. You attribute your success to skills, but your failures to randomness.

A more human version can be read in Seneca’s “Letters from a Stoic”, a soothing and surprisingly readable book that I distribute to my trader friends (Seneca also took his own life when cornered by destiny).

…

Recall that ideas do not truly sink in when emotions come into play; we do not use our rational brain outside of classrooms. Self-help books (even when they are not written by charlatans) are largely ineffectual. Good, enlightened (and “friendly”) advice and eloquent sermons do not register for more than a few moments when they go against our wiring.

There is an asymmetry, as these executives have almost nothing to lose. Assume that two equally charismatic, empty-suit-style twin brothers manage to climb the corporate ladder to get two different jobs in two different corporations. Assume that they own good looking suits, that they have MBAs, and that they are tall (the only truly visible predictor of corporate success is to be taller than average). They flip coins in secret and randomly take completely opposite actions, leading to great failure for one and great success for the other. We end up with a mildly wealthy, but fired, executive and his extremely wealthy, and still operating, twin brother. The shareholder bore the risk; the executives got the reward.
The problem is old as leadership. Our attribution of heroism to those who took crazy decisions but were lucky enough to win shows the aberration, we continue to worship those who won battles and despise those who lost, no matter the reason. I wonder how many historians use luck in their interpretations of success, or how many are conscious of the difference between process and result.

Some of these chapters were composed and discussed as part of the “Odean Circle”, as my friends and I met with a varying degree of regularity (on Wednesdays at 10 p.m. after my Courant class) at the bar of the restaurant Odean in Tribeca.

The prominent mathematician David Mumford, a Fields medalist, repents for his former scorn from probability. He writes in “The Dawning of the Age of Stochasticity (Mumford, 1999): “For over two millennia, Aristotle’s logic has rules over the thinking of Western Intellectuals...”

Keynes’ “Treatise on Probability” (Keynes, 1989, 1920) remains in many people’s opinion the most important single work on the subject, particularly considering Keynes’ youth at the time of composition (it was published years after he finished it). In it he develops the critical notion of subjective probability.
