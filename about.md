Hi there!

I'm Magnus, an econ PhD student with focus on quantitative finance at the University of Gothenburg. This is my personal page where I upload posts to share with friends and initiate discussions.

I'm passionate about research and innovation. Much of my time is spent with finance/economics, mathematics, coding, machine learning, philosophy or other projects.

Feel free to email me at <a href="mailto:{{ site.email }}">{{ site.email }}</a>.
