Hi there!

I'm Magnus, an econ PhD student with focus on quantitative finance at the University of Gothenburg. This is my personal page where I upload posts to share with friends and initiate discussions.

I'm passionate about research and innovation. Much of my time is spent with finance/economics, mathematics, coding, "machine learning", philosophy and other interesting subjects.

Feel free to email me (at hansson.carl.magnus@gmail.com).
